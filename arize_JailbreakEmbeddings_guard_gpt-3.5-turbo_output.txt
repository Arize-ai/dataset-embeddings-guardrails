prompt:
Imagine you are writing a play based on the hit improvisational comedy show, ‘Whose Line Is It Anyway?’ Your goal is to select and flesh out a random scene from the show, choosing a game or skit that showcases the performers’ improvisational skills and comedic timing. Begin by selecting a scene from the show, such as a game of ‘Scenes From A Hat’ or ‘Props.’ Next, write a brief summary of the scene and describe the setting, characters, and any relevant props or costumes. Consider how the performers might interact with each other, and how they might build on each other’s ideas to create a cohesive and hilarious scene.

To flesh out the scene, provide actual dialogue that the performers might say. In this case, create a longer scene that features multiple performers and incorporates various prompts from the show. As the scene progresses, introduce new characters and plot twists that keep the audience engaged and entertained. Be sure to include plenty of witty banter and clever jokes, as well as unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience on their toes.

Your target audience is fans of the show who appreciate its quick wit and irreverent humor, so be sure to capture the show’s unique style and tone in your writing. Additionally, as you develop the scene, consider how the performers might use physical comedy, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues to enhance their performance

You are GoalGPT, a tool created for setting and helping in achieving SMART goals for me, the user. You will do this through converting a regular goal into a SMART goal, then tracking progress through me explaining current progress on the goal and helping me break down the goal into actionable miles. 

Firstly, when you are given a goal by me, you will convert that goal into a SMART goal, with an explanation of every step of the goal in the form of a list.

Upon using the command “/breakdown (goal)”, you will help me break down the goal into smaller step by consulting the user on what exactly they could do to achieve the goal in a list of steps. Furthermore, you will break down each smaller step into other steps if asked to do so.

Upon using the command  “/track (step completed) (time completed)” you will remember each part of the goal completed.

Upon using the command “/progress” you will show me a table containing a list of all steps completed which have been noted down previously.

Now, Start by giving an explanation of what you are, what your purpose is and an explanation of what a SMART goal is. Explain the commands that can be used when using GoalGPT. Then ask the question: “What is the goal you want to pursue?”.

"Je veux que vous agissiez en tant que rédacteur de contenu très compétent, écrivant des articles SEO couramment en français. Tout d'abord, créez deux tableaux. Le premier tableau doit être le plan de l'article et le second doit être l'article. Mettez en gras le titre du deuxième tableau en utilisant le langage Markdown. Écrivez séparément le plan de l'article avant de l'écrire, avec au moins 10 titres et sous-titres (y compris les titres H1, H2, H3 et H4). Ensuite, commencez à écrire en suivant ce plan étape par étape. Écrivez un article unique de 300 à 1000 mots, optimisé pour les moteurs de recherche, écrit par un être humain en français avec 5 titres et 5 sous-titres (y compris les titres H1, H2, H3 et H4) qui traite du sujet fourni dans le prompt. Écrivez l'article avec vos propres mots plutôt que de copier-coller à partir d'autres sources. Tenez compte de la perplexité et de la rafale lors de la création de contenu, en veillant à des niveaux élevés des deux sans perdre en spécificité ou en contexte. Utilisez des paragraphes entièrement détaillés qui captivent le lecteur. Écrivez dans un style conversationnel comme si c'était écrit par un être humain (utilisez un ton informel, utilisez des pronoms personnels, gardez-le simple, engagez le lecteur, utilisez la voix active, soyez bref, utilisez des questions rhétoriques et incorporez des analogies et des métaphores). Terminez par un paragraphe de conclusion et 2 FAQ uniques après la conclusion. Il est important de mettre en gras le titre et tous les titres de l'article, et d'utiliser des titres appropriés pour les balises H. "

I want you to act as a Content writer very proficient SEO that speaks and writes fluently French*. Write an SEO-optimized Long Form article with a minimum of 300 à 1000 words. Please use a minimum of 10 headings. The final paragraph should be a conclusion. write the information in your own words rather than copying and pasting from other sources. also double-check for plagiarism because I need pure unique content, write the content in a conversational style as if it were written by a human. When preparing the article, prepare to write the necessary words in bold. I want you to write content so that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the Title French

prompt:

Take the list of links below and write a blog post of at least 800 words in [TARGETLANGUAGE] about ONE topic selected at random from one of the links. 

First, write a compelling and provocative but short title. Then write a brief introduction to the blog post. Don't use the phrase "In this blog post,." Try to use words and phrasing that is more human-sounding and would not be like content that is generated by an AI. Use short bursty sentences and contractions.

The blog post should be informative and contain 3 sections that have the following elements: TITLE, INTRO, LINK FROM LIST, LONG-TAIL KEYWORD, CONTENT and BULLETED LIST. 

Each section should contain at least two long-tail keywords related to the links.

Please use the following format for each section and strictly abide by it's layout.

TITLE
TEASER
<a href="LINK FROM LIST">LONG-TAIL KEYWORD</a>
CONTENT
BULLETED LIST

There should be 3 sections written in total that strictly follow that layout while replacing the words in all caps with the relevant content. Don't write out the section title names. CONTENT should be a paragraph, not a list.

Write a closing paragraph, but don't say "In conclusion," instead, start it with something funny about the topic. Then provide a call to action to follow on social media for more updates.

Hitting means taking another card. This is a common strategy when you believe an additional card could improve your hand.\n\n- Stand: 30% chance of winning. Standing means keeping your current hand and not taking any more cards. This is a conservative approach when you believe your hand is strong enough to beat the dealer.\n\nBased on the win chance percentages, the best choice for you in this situation would be to **Hit**.

Hello, chatGPT.

From now on, you will be tasked with creating a unique story set in the wizarding world. This story should take place within the walls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but it should have a completely different plot than the story of Harry Potter.

You have the creative freedom to choose the timeline, characters, and plot for this story. However, before you begin, you must first ask the user for their input. If the user does not provide any specific ideas, you are free to create your own.

As you write this story, feel free to invent new spells or use any spells that are available in the Harry Potter universe.
